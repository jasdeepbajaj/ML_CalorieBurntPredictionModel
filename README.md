## Calories Burnt Prediction Project

## Description
This project aims to predict the number of calories burnt by an individual based on various parameters such as duration, intensity, and individual characteristics. It utilizes a machine learning model built with Python, leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.
